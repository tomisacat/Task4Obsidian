# v0.1.1 — Initial Release

The first public release of **Tasks**, an outliner-focused task management plugin for Obsidian.

## Features

### Task Syntax
- Recognizes `TODO`, `DOING`, `DONE`, `CANCELED`, and `WAITING` as task states.
- Optional list bullets (`-` or `*`) before the state keyword.
- Optional priorities: `[#A]`, `[#B]`, `[#C]` immediately after the state.
- Inline `#tags` are indexed and filterable.
- `key:: value` property lines beneath a task are parsed and editable.

### Task Panel
- Side pane listing all tasks in your vault, grouped by page.
- Each task is a clickable card — click to jump to that line in the note (cursor + scroll).
- State button cycles `TODO → DOING → DONE → CANCELED`.
- Priority button cycles `— → #C → #B → #A`.
- Pencil button opens a property editor modal.
- Inline tags are styled with italic accent color.
- Auto-refreshes when files change in the vault.

### Query Filters
- Expand/collapse via chevron in the header.
- Filter by **State**, **Priority**, **Tags** (space-separated, substring match), and **Property** (key/value dropdowns populated from your tasks).
- Multiple property filters (AND logic) with "+ Add filter".
- "Clear filters" button resets all filters.

### Property Editor
- Modal dialog to add, edit, or remove `key:: value` pairs on any task.
- KEY / VALUE labeled inputs in a clean two-column layout.
- Changes are written back to the markdown file and re-indexed.

### Commands
- **Open Tasks view** — opens the Tasks side pane.
- **Cycle task state at cursor** — cycles the state keyword on the current editor line. Assignable as a hotkey under Settings → Hotkeys → Tasks.

## Notes
- Desktop only (macOS, Windows, Linux).
- No settings tab in this release; defaults are fixed (group by page).
- Requires Obsidian v1.7.0+.
